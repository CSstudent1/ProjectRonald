# ProjectRonald
Project Ronald is set to be a Futuristic FPS nuclear military war game, now my idea of futuristic isn't something crazy like a whole 
century ahead of today. This game is going to be a more modern futuristic like maybe 50- 75 years from now. 
This game is being made with the intentions of going up against the Call of Duty franchise, Battle Field Franchise, and 
the very well respected Fallout Franchise to push them to innovate the gaming scene as we know it today. 
With a true immersive and intense story line, and a killer multiplayer experience.

YOU can help this game become even better by sharing your code and IDEAS that you think would make this game even better than it already
will be.
